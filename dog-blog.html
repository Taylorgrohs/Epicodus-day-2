    <h2>Entry 1: Wow I love food!!</h2>
    <p>Hey can you believe how good food is? My favorite food is the kind that comes from a can.
      Dry food is totally wack.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Entry 2: Walks are awesome!!!</h2>
    <p>Going on walks is so great! I love going outside and walking around. I especially like meeting other dogs and running off my leash.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Entry 3: My owner is the best!</h2>
    <p>I love my owner so much! He gives me food and chills with me. We go on walks and hang out, he is the best. </p>
